\chapter*{Abstract}

In theoretical computer science, program logics are essential for verifying the
correctness of software. Hoare logic provides a systematic way of reasoning
about program correctness using preconditions and postconditions. This thesis
explores the development and application of an abstract Hoare logic framework
that generalizes traditional Hoare logic by using arbitrary elements of
complete lattices as the assertion language, extrapolating what makes Hoare
logic sound and complete. We also demonstrate the practical applications of
this framework by obtaining a program logic for hyperproperties, highlighting
its versatility and benefits. From the design of Abstract Hoare logic, we
define Reverse Abstract Hoare logic, which is used to develop systems for
backward correctness reasoning on programs.
