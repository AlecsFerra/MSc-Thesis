\section{Hoare logic}
\label{chp:inst-hoare}

Following Observation \ref{obs:post}, the abstract inductive semantics, when 
using $(\pow{\states}, \subseteq)$ as the domain and 
$\bsem{b}^{\pow{\states}}(P) = \{ \bsem{b}(\sigma) \downarrow \; \mid \sigma 
\in P \}$ as the basic command semantics, is equivalent to the denotational 
semantics given in Definition \ref{def:deno}. As we can see from the definitions 
of Hoare Logic (Definition \ref{def:hoare}) and Abstract Hoare Logic (Definition 
\ref{def:aht}), they are equivalent. Hence, in this abstraction, Abstract Hoare 
Logic and Hoare Logic have the same formulation. Since both proof systems are 
sound and (relatively) complete, they are equivalent.
