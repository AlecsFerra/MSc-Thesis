\chapter{Extending the proof system}

The proof system for Abstract Hoare logic (definition \ref{def:ahtrules}) is
rather minimalistic. The objective of Abstract Hoare logic is to establish a
comprehensive framework for developing Hoare-like logics, aiming to impose as
few assumptions as possible on both the assertion language and the semantics of
base commands. Throughout this chapter, we explore the potential to derive
additional sound rules for the proof system by introducing more constraints
either on the lattice of assertions or on the semantics of base commands.
