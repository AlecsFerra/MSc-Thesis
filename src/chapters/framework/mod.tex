\chapter{The abstract Hoare logic framework}


In this chapter, we will develop the minimal theory of \textit{Abstract Hoare
Logic}. We will formalize the extensible language $\lang$, a minimal imperative
programming language that is parametric on a set of basic commands to permit
the definition of arbitrary program features, such as pointers, objects, etc.
We will define the semantics of the language, provide the standard definition
of Hoare triples, and introduce the concept of abstract inductive semantics; a
modular approach to express the strongest postcondition of a program, where the
assertion language is a complete lattice. Additionally, we will present a sound
and complete proof system to reason about these properties.
