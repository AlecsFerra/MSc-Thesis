\chapter{Extending the proof system}

The proof system for Abstract Hoare logic (definition \ref{def:ahtrules}) is 
pretty barebone. The goal of Abstract Hoare logic is to define a general 
theory for constructing Hoare-like logics, so the idea was to have the least 
possible assumptions on the assertion language and on the semantics of the base
commands. In this chapter, we will see how by adding more requirements on the 
lattice of the assertions and/or the semantics of the base commands, we can 
obtain new sound rules for the proof system.
