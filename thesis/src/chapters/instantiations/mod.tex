\chapter{Instantiating Abstract Hoare Logic}

In this chapter, we will show how to instantiate abstract Hoare logic to create 
new proof systems. We will also demonstrate that the framework of abstract Hoare 
logic is so general that, in some instantiations, it is able to reason about 
properties that are not expressible in standard Hoare logic.
