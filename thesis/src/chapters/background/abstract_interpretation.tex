\section{Abstract Interpretation}

Abstract interpretation \cite{Cousot77} is the leading technique used for static 
program analysis. The specification of a program can be expressed as a pair of 
initial and final sets of states, $Init, Final \in \pow{\states}$, and the task 
of verifying a program $C$ involves checking if $\sem{C}(Init) \subseteq Final$.

Clearly, this task cannot be performed programmatically in general. The solution 
proposed by the framework of abstract interpretation is to construct an 
approximation, usually denoted by $\sem{\cdot}^\#$, that is computable.

\subsection{Abstract Domains}

One of the techniques used by abstract interpretation to make the problem of 
verification tractable involves representing collections of states with a finite 
amount of memory.

\begin{definition}[Abstract Domain]
  A poset $(A, \leq)$ is an abstract domain if there exists a Galois insertion
  $\langle \pow{\states}, \subseteq \rangle \galoiS{\alpha}{\gamma} \langle A, 
  \leq \rangle$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[Interval Domain]
  \label{exmp:interval}
  Let $Int = \{ [a, b] \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z} \cup \{+\infty, -\infty \}, a 
  \leq b \} \cup \{ \bot \}$ be ordered by set inclusion. Then, there is a 
  Galois insertion from $Int$ to $\pow{\mathbb{Z}}$ defined as:
  $$\gamma(A) = \begin{cases}
    \{ x \mid a \leq x \leq b \} & \text{if } A = [a, b] \\
    \emptyset & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$$
  $$\alpha(C) = \begin{cases}
    [\min C, \max C] & \text{if } C \neq \emptyset \\
    \bot & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$$
\end{example}

The fundamental goal of abstract interpretation is to provide an approximation 
of the non-computable aspects of program semantics. The core concept is captured 
by the definition of soundness:

\begin{definition}[Soundness]
  Given an abstract domain $A$, an abstract function $f^\# : A \to A$ is a 
  sound approximation of a concrete function $f : \pow{\states} \to 
  \pow{\states}$ if
  $$\alpha(f(P)) \leq f^\#(\alpha(P))$$
\end{definition}

Hence, the goal of abstract interpretation is to construct a sound 
over-approximation of the program semantics that is computable (efficiently).
