\chapter{Conclusions}

We extendedn traditional Hoare logic into a more abstract and versatile 
framework. By incorporating principles from order theory and abstract 
interpretation, we developed a robust method for reasoning about a broader range 
of program properties. This abstract Hoare logic framework maintains the 
foundational principles of soundness and completeness while expanding its 
applicability.

We have shown that multiple program logics known in literature are actually 
special cases of Abstract Hoare logic, while constructing a program logic for 
hyperproperties in the framework of Abstract Hoare logic we also provided a 
compositional definition of strongest hyper postcondition.


Additionally, we have introduced the concept of Reverse Abstract Hoare logic, 
which enhances the framework by enabling backward reasoning by reusing the ideas
from Abstract Hoare logic. 

Throughout this work, we have demonstrated the practical applications of our 
framework through various examples and instantiations. These examples illustrate 
the versatility and effectiveness of the Abstract Hoare logic framework.

\section{Future work}
The following are only preliminary results that we weren't able to explore
because of time constraints.

\subsection{Under-approximating logics}
Hoare-style logics have not only been used to perform over-approximate
reasoning. Incorrectness logic \cite{OHearn19} uses the same framework as Hoare
logic but focuses on under-approximation. An incorrectness triple is defined as
$\htriple{P}{C}{Q} \iff \sem{C}(P) \supseteq Q$. The definition of easy
represents the same in Abstract Hoare logic. Validity differs from Hoare logic
in the direction of set inclusion, so we could easily provide the definition
for Abstract Incorrectness Logic triples $\atriple{P}{C}{Q} \iff \asem{C}(P)
\geq_A Q$ and perform the same translation that we did for the rules of Hoare
Logic for the rules of Incorrectness logic.

\subsection{Hyper domains}
We used hyper domains to construct program logics that that are able to reason
about hyperproperties, but we didn't explore what kind of calculi proofsystem 
they create when they are used to instantiate Reverse Hoare logic and on the 
opposite lattice.

\section{Related work}

The idea of systematically constructing program logics is not new. Kleene
Algebra with Tests (KAT) \cite{Kozen97} was one of the first works of this
kind. In section \ref{chp:join-meet-rules}, we discussed how, in general, we
cannot distribute non-deterministic choice ($\asem{(C_1 + C_2) \fcmp C_3} \neq
\asem{(C_1 \fcmp C_3) + (C_2 \fcmp C_3)}$), thus violating one of the axioms of
Kleene algebras. Another similar alternative was proposed in \cite{Martin06},
using traced monoidal categories to encode properties of the program. For
example, the monoidal structure is used to model non-deterministic choice but
imposes the same distributivity requirements as Kleene Algebras (this is caused
by $\oplus$ being a bifunctor). However, disregarding expressivity, the main
difference lies in the philosophy behind the approach. Abstract Hoare Logic is
a more semantics-centered approach instead of being an "equational" theory like
KAT. This semantics-centered approach was also vital in providing the idea that
abstract inductive semantics could be used not only to encode the strongest
postcondition but also the strongest liberal postcondition, weakest
precondition, and weakest liberal precondition, thereby unifying all partial
Hoare-like logics.

A more similar approach to that of Abstract Hoare Logic is Outcome Logic
\cite{Zilberstein23}. Like Abstract Hoare Logic, the semantics of the language
in Outcome Logic is parametric on the domain of execution, but the assertion
language is fixed if we ignore the basic assertions on program states. Outcome
Logic originally aimed to unify correctness and incorrectness reasoning with
the powerset instantiation, not to be a minimal theory for sound and complete
Hoare-like logics. In fact, the relative completeness proof is missing. As
discussed in \cite{Darnier2023}, Outcome Logic with the powerset instantiation
is actually a proof system for 2-hyperproperties (hyperproperties regarding at
most two executions). Thus, Outcome triples can be proved in the instantiation
of Abstract Hoare Logic provided in section \ref{chp:hyper}, even though it
would be interesting to find a direct encoding of Outcome Logic in terms of
Abstract Hoare Logic.
