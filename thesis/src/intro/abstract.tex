\chapter*{Abstract}

In theoretical computer science, program logics are essential for verifying the 
correctness of software. Hoare logic, provides a systematic way of reasoning 
about program correctness using preconditions and postconditions. This thesis 
explores the development and application of an abstract Hoare logic framework 
that generalizes traditional Hoare logic by using arbitrary elements of complete
lattices as the assertion language, extrapolating what makes Hoare logic sound
sound and complete. We also demonstrate the practical application of this 
framework through by obtaining a program logic for hyperproperties, 
highlighting its versatility and efficacy.
